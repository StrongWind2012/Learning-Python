    "## 5 Linked Lists with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A Linked List is, as the word implies, a list where the nodes are linked together. Each node contains data and a pointer. The way they are linked together is that each node points to where in the memory the next node is placed.\n",
    "## 5.1Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list consists of nodes with some sort of data, and a pointer, or link, to the next node.\n",
    "A singly linked list.\n",
    "## 5.2Linked Lists vs Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to understand linked lists is perhaps by comparing linked lists with arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists consist of nodes, and is a linear data structure we make ourselves, unlike arrays which is an existing data structure in the programming language that we can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes in a linked list store links to other nodes, but array elements do not need to store links to other elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: How linked lists and arrays are stored in memory is explained in detail on the page Linked Lists in Memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below compares linked lists with arrays to give a better understanding of what linked lists are.\n",
    "\tArrays \tLinked Lists\n",
    "An existing data structure in the programming language \tYes \tNo\n",
    "Fixed size in memory \tYes \tNo\n",
    "Elements, or nodes, are stored right after each other in memory (contiguously) \tYes \tNo\n",
    "Memory usage is low\n",
    "(each node only contains data, no links to other nodes) \tYes \tNo\n",
    "Elements, or nodes, can be accessed directly (random access) \tYes \tNo\n",
    "Elements, or nodes, can be inserted or deleted in constant time, no shifting operations in memory needed. \tNo \tYes\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some key linked list properties, compared to arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Linked lists are not allocated to a fixed size in memory like arrays are, so linked lists do not require to move the whole list into a larger memory space when the fixed memory space fills up, like arrays must.\n",
    "    Linked list nodes are not laid out one right after the other in memory (contiguously), so linked list nodes do not have to be shifted up or down in memory when nodes are inserted or deleted.\n",
    "    Linked list nodes require more memory to store one or more links to other nodes. Array elements do not require that much memory, because array elements do not contain links to other elements.\n",
    "    Linked list operations are usually harder to program and require more lines than similar array operations, because programming languages have better built in support for arrays.\n",
    "    We must traverse a linked list to find a node at a specific position, but with arrays we can access an element directly by writing myArray[5].\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.3Types of Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three basic forms of linked lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Singly linked lists\n",
    "    Doubly linked lists\n",
    "    Circular linked lists\n",
    "\n",
    "A singly linked list is the simplest kind of linked lists. It takes up less space in memory because each node has only one address to the next node, like in the image below.\n",
    "A singly linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "A doubly linked list has nodes with addresses to both the previous and the next node, like in the image below, and therefore takes up more memory. But doubly linked lists are good if you want to be able to move both up and down in the list.\n",
    "A doubly linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "A circular linked list is like a singly or doubly linked list with the first node, the \"head\", and the last node, the \"tail\", connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "In singly or doubly linked lists, we can find the start and end of a list by just checking if the links are null. But for circular linked lists, more complex code is needed to explicitly check for start and end nodes in certain applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Circular linked lists are good for lists you need to cycle through continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below is an example of a singly circular linked list:\n",

    "## 5.4Linked List Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic things we can do with linked lists are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Traversal\n",
    "    Remove a node\n",
    "    Insert a node\n",
    "    Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, singly linked lists will be used to explain these operations below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Traversing a linked list means to go through the linked list by following the links from one node to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traversal of linked lists is typically done to search for a specific node, and read or modify the node's content, remove the node, or insert a node right before or after that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "To traverse a singly linked list, we start with the first node in the list, the head node, and follow that node's next link, and the next node's next link and so on, until the next address is null.\n",
    "\n",

    "If you want to delete a node in a linked list, it is important to connect the nodes on each side of the node before deleting it, so that the linked list is not broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "So before deleting the node, we need to get the next pointer from the previous node, and connect the previous node to the new next node before deleting the node in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is a good idea to first connect next pointer to the node after the node we want to delete, before we delete it. This is to avoid a 'dangling' pointer, a pointer that points to nothing, even if it is just for a brief moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation below shows the node we want to delete, and how the list must be traversed first to connect the list properly before deleting the node without breaking the linked list."
